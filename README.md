# MTL-single_shot
Single shot structured light imaging based on multi-task learning: an effective depth perception approach without calibration
## abstract
We generated a dataset for single-frame stripe structured light depth estimation, which contains 612 training stripe images and 72 test stripe images, with a unified size of 480Ã—640 and corresponding depth labels and phase labels. , for users studying single-frame depth estimation. The data set contains multiple stripe structured light images from different angles of the model from the thingi10k database. At the same time, we also generated a large number of randomly generated combination stripe structured light images. Due to storage reasons, this part of the data set and code were not uploaded to the warehouse, but We can be consulted upon reasonable request. Our dataset supports research and education in multiple areas such as computer vision and machine learning, and we have also tested some baseline methods, including U-Net and so on.
